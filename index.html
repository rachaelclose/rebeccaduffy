      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Rebecca Duffy (she/her/hers), and I'm a Communication Studies major at Emerson College.
      </p>

      <p>I consider myself a messaging strategist, someone who thinks deeply about how people connect, communicate, and
        understand one another.</p>

      <p>Using my skills in strategic messaging, data analysis, and audience engagement, I work to make a meaningful
        difference. These abilities have shaped my volunteer and consulting roles, where I’ve supported families and
        unhoused individuals in Boston while helping strengthen community outreach and advocacy efforts.</p>

      <h3>What is Communication Studies?</h3>
      <p>To me, Communication Studies is about connecting people and ideas with purpose. At Emerson, I’ve learned to
        craft meaningful messages, understand audiences, and apply communication for real community impact. It’s shown
        me how communication can create change, and it’s the foundation for why I care deeply about the work I do.</p>

      <h3>Relevant Coursework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The U.S. and Latin America (POL-230):</strong> Analyzed U.S.–Latin American political relations and
          researched human rights issues in El Salvador.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Development (PL-250):</strong> Examined global development models, inequality, and
          equitable access within sustainability initiatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Special Events (CC-319):</strong> Developed event planning skills and created fundraising concepts
          for nonprofit organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Nonprofit Communication Management (CC-315):</strong> Studied nonprofit operations, mission
          communication, and stakeholder engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Political Communication:</strong> Analyzed international media systems, propaganda, and
          global information flows.</li>
